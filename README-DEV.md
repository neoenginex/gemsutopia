## 🔧 INCOMPLETE FEATURES & TODO LIST

### 🛒 **E-Commerce Core**
- [ ] **Inventory Tracking** - Not live across entire site, real-time updates failing, needs live synchronization between admin panel and customer-facing pages

### 💳 **Payment Processing (50% Complete - TEST MODE ONLY)**

- [ ] **Configure Bitcoin mainnet** - Switch from testnet, add Reese's mainnet wallet

### 🛡️ **Security & Admin (Needs 2025 Standards Overhaul)**
- [ ] **Implement OAuth 2.0 + PKCE** - Replace current auth with Authorization Code flow + PKCE for public clients
- [ ] **Upgrade JWT security** - 256-bit cryptographically secure secrets for token signing
- [ ] **Multi-layered rate limiting** - IP-based, user-based, endpoint-specific limits (currently not properly implemented)
- [ ] **API Gateway implementation** - Centralize security enforcement (auth, rate limiting, logging)
- [ ] **TLS 1.3 enforcement** - Upgrade from current TLS implementation
- [ ] **RBAC/ABAC authorization** - Role-Based + Attribute-Based Access Control
- [ ] **Dynamic risk assessment** - Real-time request pattern analysis

- [ ] **Input validation & sanitization** - Server-side validation for all API endpoints
- [ ] **CORS configuration** - Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing setup

- [ ] **Live/Dev Environment Toggle** - Not complete, environment separation incomplete
- [ ] **Order Tracking System** - Almost done but not live

### 📧 **Customer Communications (Major Issues)**

- [ ] **Fix real-time inventory updates** - Not live across entire site, inventory sync failing

1. **Payment systems** - All in test mode, no live payments configured
2. **Email receipts** - Not working, customers won't get confirmation
3. **Address validation** - Not working, shipping failures guaranteed
4. **Customer order tracking** - Customers can't track orders post-purchase

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS REALITY CHECK

**What Works:**
