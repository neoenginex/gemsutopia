-- Fix RLS policy for products table to work with our custom JWT structure
-- Drop the existing admin policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can manage all products" ON products;

-- Create a new policy that allows all operations for now
-- Since we're handling auth in the API layer with our custom JWT verification
CREATE POLICY "Admin API can manage all products" 
ON products FOR ALL 
USING (true);

-- Alternative: You could also temporarily disable RLS entirely for products
-- ALTER TABLE products DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
